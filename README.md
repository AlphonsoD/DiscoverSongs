# DiscoverSongs

### Link: https://ad-discoversongs.herokuapp.com
Note: Heroku is getting rid of free dynos soon (end of November 2022), so if the link above doesn't work, then that means my free dynos have expired :( 
I will look for another (hopefully free) hosting service in the meantime!

## App Info
This is a web app that gives song recommendations based on a given song. The purpose of creating this app was to gain experience using the Spotify Web API, React, NodeJS, and website deployment.

## Running Instructions
To run the app locally, first run 'npm install' in both the parent and client folders. Then, run 'npm start' in the parent folder to start the server, then in another terminal, cd into the client folder and run 'npm start' to start the client.
